**Hand Gesture Control for Volume and Brightness**

This project demonstrates hand gesture control for adjusting system volume and screen brightness using the Mediapipe library and various system-level libraries. By tracking hand landmarks, the program interprets hand gestures to control the audio volume and screen brightness.

**Overview**
The Hand Gesture Control project utilizes computer vision techniques to interpret hand gestures captured by your webcam.

**It offers the following functionalities:**
**Control Volume:** Adjust the system's audio volume by moving your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart.
**Control Brightness:** Adjust the screen brightness by moving your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart on the right side of the screen.
**Visual Feedback:** Real-time feedback on screen shows the volume and brightness levels being adjusted.

**Requirements:**

To run this project, you need the following libraries and tools:
OpenCV (cv2)
Mediapipe
ctypes
comtypes
pycaw
wmi
win32api

**Install these libraries using the following command:**
pip install opencv-python mediapipe comtypes pycaw wmi pywin32

**How to Use**
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-control.git
Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory: cd hand-gesture-control

**Run the script:** python hand_gesture_control.py
Position your hand in front of your webcam, and move your thumb and index finger to control volume and brightness.
Hand Gestures
To control volume, move your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart on the left side of the screen.
To control brightness, move your thumb and index finger closer or farther apart on the right side of the screen.
Features
Volume control using hand gestures.
Brightness control using hand gestures.
Visual feedback of volume and brightness levels.

**Customization**
You can adjust the following parameters in the code to customize the behavior of the hand gesture control:
**model_complexity:** Set the complexity of the hand tracking model.
**min_detection_confidence:** Minimum confidence level for hand detection.
**min_tracking_confidence:** Minimum confidence level for tracking hand landmarks.
**brightFactor:** Adjust the sensitivity of brightness control.
